# Cinema Management System - SD2 Project

This project is a Cinema Management System developed in Java. It is designed to handle cinema seat bookings and manage user information efficiently. The system offers the following key functionalities:

- Buying Tickets: Allows users to book seats and stores their details.
- Canceling Tickets: Enables users to cancel existing bookings.
- Viewing the Seating Plan: Displays the current seat availability in a visual format.
- Finding the First Available Seat: Quickly identifies the next free seat.
- Printing Ticket Information: Provides a summary of ticket details and user information.
- Saving Ticket Details to Files: Exports ticket data into text files for persistence.
- Searching and Sorting Tickets: Facilitates finding and organizing ticket records based on criteria.


The system employs object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, using separate classes for Tickets and Persons to encapsulate relevant data and operations. A robust menu-driven interface ensures user-friendly interaction. File handling is implemented to save and delete ticket information, adding a layer of persistence to the system.

This project demonstrates core Java concepts like encapsulation, exception handling, file operations, and modular programming.
